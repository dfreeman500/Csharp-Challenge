# Technical-Interview



An output challenge for a technical interview:
I timed using string builder or using += for string outputs and String builder was much quicker 


#
The top output uses normal strings which are recreated with each += and this took 26 ms.







The bottom ouput uses StringBuilder which was much quicker - 2ms.
